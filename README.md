don't really expect anyone to use this I just don't want to lose all of this if my computer breaks. For my own sake though, you play both sides, however you can invoke the computer AI by either right clicking, or middle clicking. 
The middle click does a full search of every possible move and executes the best one, but it takes a long time. the right click does a sort of half search where it does not bother checking moves that go backwards, as they are rarely used. it only takes 30 seconds.
